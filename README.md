# zk-blueprints

**zk-blueprints** is a collection of mathematical formulations and circuit designs supporting zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, focusing on efficiently implementing provable computations in ZK circuits. This repository provides formal descriptions, constraints, and structured blueprints for designing circuits that preserve privacy while ensuring verifiable correctness.

## Features
- ðŸ“– **Mathematical Formulations** â€“ Rigorous explanations of key principles underlying ZK circuit design.
- ðŸ›  **Circuit Constraints** â€“ Well-documented approaches to encoding computations in finite fields.
- âš¡ **Implementation Guidelines** â€“ Blueprints for translating mathematical constructs into efficient circuit implementations.
- ðŸ”’ **Use Cases** â€“ Applications in cryptographic protocols, zk-SNARKs, and privacy-preserving machine learning.

This repository aims to serve as a structured reference for researchers, developers, and practitioners working on ZK-proof systems, offering both theoretical insights and practical implementations.
